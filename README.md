This application uses Pillow library to add a watermark text to a given image. It was created using Pyton v3.13.

First, update the IMAGE_PATH variable with your image path. Adjust the FONT_PERCENT and MARGIN_PERCENT variables to modify the watermark's size and margin - the percent is relative to the image size. After running main.py, you'll be prompted to enter the watermark text and its position. Once the app finishes running, the watermarked image will be saved in the /images directory with the name watermarked_image.png.
