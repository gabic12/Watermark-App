This application uses Pillow library to add a watermark text to a given image. It was created using Pyton v3.13.

First, update the IMAGE_PATH variable with your image path. Adjust the FONT_PERCENT and MARGIN_PERCENT variables to modify the watermark's size and margin - the percent is relative to the image size. After you run main.py, you will be asked to enter the watermark's text and it's position. When the app finished running, the watermarked image is saved in /images path,
